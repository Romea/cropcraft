## Description of the configuration format

### Root elements of the configuration file

* `field`: a block that contains the parameters of the generated field
* `output`: a block where each element correspond to a named output configuration
* `output_enabled` (optional): a list of output configuration name that are used when the program 
  is executed.
  If it is not specified, all defined output are applied.

### The `field` block

```yaml
field:
  headland_width: 7.0
  scattering_extra_width: 1.5
  random_seed: 344567809264
  beds:
    my_bed1:
      ...
    my_bed2:
      ...
  noise: {}
  weeds:
    weed1:
      ...
    weed2:
      ...
  stones: {}
```

* `headland_width` (default: 4.0, in meters): an extra band of ground around the field.
* `scattering_extra_width` (default: 1.0, in meters): an extra band around the field used to
  generate scattering.
* `random_seed` (optional): integer used to initialize the random number generator.
  If this element is specified, the generated environment will always be the same if the program is
  executed several times with no change in its configuration.
  The program outputs its seed in order to use it in a configuration file and generate a similar
  environment.
* `beds`: a block that contains the configuration of each bed to generate.
  The key correspond to the name of the bed and the value is a bed block (described below).
* `noise` (optional): a block that contains the noise configuration.
* `weeds` (optional): a block that contains the configuration of each weed scattering.
* `stones` (optional): a block that contains the stones scattering configuration.

It is also possible to specify the parameters of the bed block directly in the `field` block.
In this case, these parameters are used as default values for the beds.

#### The bed block

```yaml
my_bed1:
  plant_type: bean
  plant_height: .12
  row_distance: .52
  rows_count: 3
  bed_width: 1.57
  plants_count: 100
  beds_count: 10
  plant_distance: .15
  length: 15.
  shift_next_bed: false
  offset: [0., .3, 0.]
  y_function: '1.4 * sin(x * tau / 15.)'
  aligned: false
```

It corresponds to the element of the `beds` block of the `field`.
The key corresponds to the name of the bed.

* `plant_type`: allows to select the model group.
  The current types available are `maize` and `bean`.
* `plant_height` (in meters): the desired height for the plants.
  The models are grouped by height and are rescaled to correspond to the desired height.
* `plant_distance` (in meters): the distance between each crop in a row.
* `bed_width` (in meters): the with of the bed.
  The next bed will be generated with an offset corresponding to the `bed_width` multiplied by
  `bed_count` but only if `shift_next_bed` is disabled.
* `row_distance` (in meters): distance between two consecutive rows in the bed.
* `plants_count`: number of plants in a row. `crops_count` is also accepted.
* `length`: (in meters) length of the bed.
  It is used to compute the number of plants (only if `plants_count` is not specified)
* `rows_count` (default: 1): number of rows in a bed.
* `beds_count` (default: 1): number of bed (the same configuration is repeated).
* `shift_next_bed` (default: true): a boolean to enable/disable the shift of the next bed.
  If disabled, the next bed configuration will cover the previous one.
* `offset` (default: [0, 0, 0], in meters): a (x,y,z) offset applied to all crops of the bed
* `y_function` (default: '0.0'): a string representing a python expression used to apply a lateral
  offset depending of the `x` coordinate.
  It is equivalent to write a function _y = f(x)_ where _y_ is the lateral offset and _x_ the
  position in the row.
  You can use the `x` variable, any functions of the python `math` module and some built-in
  functions like `abs`, `min` or `max`.
* `orientation` (choice: [`random`, `aligned`, `zero`], default: `random`): if the orientation is
  `random`, the plant is oriented using a uniform distribution between 0° and 360°.
  If it is `aligned`, the angle will be 0° or 180°.
  If it is `zero`, the angle will be only 0°.

#### The `noise` block

```yaml
noise:
  position: .008
  tilt: .05
  scale: .10
  missing: .15
```

* `position` (in meters): standard deviation of a centered normal distribution.
  It is applied on the _x_ and _y_ axis of the position.
* `tilt` (in radians): standard deviation of a centered normal distribution.
  It is applied on the _roll_ and _pitch_ angle of the orientation.
* `scale` (coefficient): standard deviation of a log-normal distribution (with mu = 0)
* `missing` (between 0 and 1): probability that a crop is missing.

#### The weeds block

```yaml
weeds:
  test_weed1:
    plant_type: portulaca
    density: 3.5
    distance_min: 0.15
    noise_scale: 0.29
    noise_offset: 0.21
  test_weed2:
    plant_type: polygonum
    density: 4.9
```

The `weeds` block of the `field` contains several key/value that correspond to a name and a
scattering configuration block.

* `plant_type`: a string that corresponds to the name of the weed model
* `density`: a float that control the quantity of weeds that is generated
* `distance_min` (in meters, default: 0.12): minimal distance between generated weeds
* `scattering_mode` (default:'noise'): a string setting the mode of the scattering.
'noise' uses a random pattern controlled by the parameters `noise_scale` and `noise_offset`.
'image' uses a grayscale image to control the density
* `noise_scale` (default: 0.36): a float that control the size of the roughness of the random
  density map.
  If the value is smaller, the blob will be bigger.
* `noise_offset` (between -1.0 and 1.0, default: 0.1): a float that control the thickness of the
  empty area.
  If the value is smaller, the empty area will be bigger.
* `scattering_img`: the density image path (relative to the configuration file)

#### The `stones` block

```yaml
stones:
  density: 50.0
  distance_min: 0.04
  noise_scale: 0.36
  noise_offset: 0.23
```

* `density`: a float that control the quantity of stones that is generated
* `distance_min` (in meters, default: 0.04): minimal distance between generated stones
* `noise_scale` (default: 0.36): a float that control the size of the roughness of the random
  density map.
  If the value is smaller, the blob will be bigger.
* `noise_offset` (between -1.0 and 1.0, default: 0.23): a float that control the thickness of the
  empty area.
  If the value is smaller, the empty area will be bigger.


### The `output` block

```yaml
output_enabled: [out1]
output:
  out1:
    type: blender_file
    ...
  out2:
    type: gazebo_model
    ...
  out3:
    type: description
    ...
```

The `output` block contains several key/value that correspond to a name that can be referenced by
`output_enabled` and a configuration block:

* `type`: the output type. Available: `blender_file` or `gazebo_model`

The other parameters of the output block depends of the `type`.

#### Output type `blender_file`

```yaml
out1:
  type: blender_file
  filename: small_field.blend
```

* `filename`: file name (and optionally a relative path) of the generated blender file

#### Output type `gazebo_model`

```yaml
out2:
  type: gazebo_model
  name: maize_field
  author: John Smith
  use_absolute_path: false
```

* `name`: name (and optionally a relative path) of the gazebo model directory to create
* `author` (optional): a string to add in the author field of the model config file
* `use_absolute_path` (optional, default: false): a boolean to enable/disable use of absolute path
  for resources used in the SDF file.

#### Output type `description`

```yaml
out3:
  type: description
  format: json
  filename: description.json
```

* `filename`: file name (and optionally a relative path) of the generated description file
* `format` (optional, choice: [`json`, `messagepack`, `compressed_messagepack`]): the format of the
  description file.
  If this option is omitted, the format will be choosen based on the extension in the `filename`.
  The following extension ae available:
  - `.json` for the JSON format
  - `.mpk` for the [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) format
  - `.mpk.gz` for a compressed MessagePack using gzip 
  If the extension is unknown, the JSON format is selected by default.
